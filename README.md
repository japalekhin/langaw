Langaw is an endless tap game featured in the game development tutorial by Japa Alekhin Llemos in [jap.alekhin.io](https://jap.alekhin.io).

The tutorial series is split into multiple parts focusing on certain stages of game development.

Using Flutter as the base framework and the [Flame](https://github.com/luanpotter/flame) plugin for it that is simple yet powerful enough to let you create all sorts of games.
